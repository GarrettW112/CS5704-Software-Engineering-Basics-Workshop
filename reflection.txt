I primarily use VSCode for my coding work.  This is because it was my first coding IDE and has not let me down in any meaningful way.
I have had limited need to use terminal based editors.  I know that I have had to use vim before, but I cannot remember what it was for.
Terminal based editors are much more tedious to use than modern editors.  However, they are many situations where the terminal is the option for communicating with a computer.
